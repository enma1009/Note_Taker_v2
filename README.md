# Note Taker App

***Author: Enid Soto***

This is a very simple application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. 

Note: this is version 2. Version 1 failed to deploy due to issues with untracked files and structure of folders. You can find the repository for version 1 [here](https://github.com/enma1009/Note_Taker).

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to get familiar with Node and Express. It was an assignment of the UM Full Stack Developer Bootcamp 2019-2020.

## Technologies used

This is a full stack application that uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and jQuery for the front-end, and Node and Express for the back-end.

## Functionality

The application uses the "Express" dependency to set routes, and get and post data from a JSON file. The user can see previously saved notes, add new notes and delete existing notes.
